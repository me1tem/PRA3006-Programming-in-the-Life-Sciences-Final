# PRA3006 Programming in the Life Sciences
The aim of this project was to identify common treatment options for 11 distinct types of cancer with the use of a SPARQL Query. The result of this Query was transformed into a JavaScript Query, and these were incoorporated into the final code to create a visualization. The visualization is in the form of a bubble chart that thus portrays the different treatment option for the specific types of cancers.
